# MIGRATION MAPPER - VERSION 3.2

## Overview
Migration Mapper is a free application designed for researchers, biologists, and managers to analyze fine-scale GPS collar data collected from terrestrial ungulates. While Migration Mapper is based in R, you do not need any coding ability to use it. Migration Mapper is written and maintained by Jerod Merkle (https://merkleresearchgroup.org/) and Josh Gage (https://www.gagecarto.com) with the Wyoming Migration Initiative (https://migrationinitiative.org/).  

## Downloading Migration Mapper
You can download Migration Mapper directly from GitHub (above); however, we prefer if you download from the Wyoming Migration Initiative's website (https://migrationinitiative.org/projects/migration-mapper/download/) so we can keep in communication with you when Migration Mapper is updated. 

## R VERSION
This current version of Migration Mapper has been built to Run with R 4.5.1. If you're using an earlier version of R you may experience problems and it is recomended you upgrade your R software.

## Getting started
Migration Mapper is a shiny app; thus, after it is downloaded, users need to unzip the folder, open the MAPP.R file in RStudio, and click 'run app'!

## Brief intro to how Migration Mapper works
Migration Mapper provides a number of applications to help users clean and analyze their GPS data with the ultimate goal of producing spatial outputs that identify movement corridors and areas of important use (e.g., stopovers or seasonal ranges). The user starts with a cleaned GPS collar dataset in ESRI Shapefile format. MAPP is modular and consists of six standalone applications representing distinct steps of the workflow. Each of the applications are accessed through the main MAPP homepage. Modularity clarifies the step-by step process and allows users to easily navigate between steps, fix errors or make changes in a previous step, or even skip certain steps in the workflow. The modules include: 1) data cleaning and review, 2-3) seasonal movement delineation, 4) movement model application, 5) calculating population-level outputs, and 6) visualizing the outputs.
