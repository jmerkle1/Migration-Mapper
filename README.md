# MIGRATION MAPPER - VERSION 3

## overview
Migration Mapper is a free application designed for researchers, biologists, and managers, to analyze fine-scale GPS collar data collected from terrestrial ungulates.

## downloading Migration Mapper
You can download directly from GitHub (above); however, we prefer if you download from the Wyoming Migration Initiative's website (https://migrationinitiative.org/content/migration-mapper-download) - so we can keep in communication with you when Migration Mapper is updated.

## brief intro to how it works
Migration Mapper provides a number of interfaces to help users analyze their data, with the ultimate goal of spatial outputs that identify movement corridors and areas of important use (e.g., stopovers or seasonal ranges). The user starts with a cleaned GPS collar dataset in ESRI Shapefile format. MAPP is modular and consists of six standalone applications representing distinct steps of the workflow. Each of the applications are accessed through the main MAPP homepage. Modularity clarifies the step-by step process and allows users to easily navigate between steps, fix errors or make changes in a previous step, or even skip certain steps in the workflow. The modules include: 1) data cleaning and review, 2-3) seasonal movement delineation, 4) movement model application, 5) calculating population-level outputs, and 6) visualizing the outputs.
